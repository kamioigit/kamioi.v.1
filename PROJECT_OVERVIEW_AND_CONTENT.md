3. **Blog Posts** - Fetches from API but may be empty. Need actual blog content.
4. **Pricing** - Plans are defined but may need copy refinement.
5. **FAQs** - Good content but may need updates based on actual product features.
6. **About Us** - Currently no dedicated "About Us" page, only mentioned in footer.
